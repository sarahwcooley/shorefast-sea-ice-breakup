# shorefast-sea-ice-breakup
Matlab scripts for detecting breakup of shorefast ice using MODIS imagery

This folder contains scripts used to detect breakup of shorefast ice using MODIS imagery, compare breakup timing with reanalysis and AWS temperature data and project breakup timing into the future using CMIP5 climate model outputs. Scripts are currently uncommented but will shortly be updated with more complete commentary.
